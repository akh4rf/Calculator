# Calculator

My first GitHub repo

Update Notes:

Version 0.1 --- Created GUI and added buttons for numbers and basic operators  
Version 0.2 --- Added listeners to buttons, implemented basic operations and equations (moves left-to-right, not PEMDAS)  
Version 0.3 --- Switched loop types in calc method and added comments  
Version 0.4 --- Flipped number pad (realized it was backwards, thanks Teagan)  
Version 0.5.0 --- Added functional buttons for CLR, x^2, SQRT, and factorial  
Version 0.5.1 (in progress) --- Fix bug encountered when executing: "=" -> "(x^2)/(SQRT)/(x!)" -> "+" -> "num" -> "="  
Version 0.5.2 (in progress) --- Address issue when factorial input is too big (recursion times out)
